Collections 
	->List -> accepting duplicate elements
	->Set -> no duplicate elements - Intersection, Union, Difference
	->Map  -> Key Value pair of elements- getKey, getValue
	->ArrayList
	->LinkedList
	->EntrySet
	->TreeSet
	->HashSet
	->HashMap
	->TreeMap
JAVA IO 
	->Input/Output -> Process the input and produce the output
	->Streams
			->Sequence of data
			->composed of bytes
			->3 different streams
					1. System.out -> Standard Output Stream
					2. System.in  -> Standard Input Stream
					3. System.err -> Standard Error Stream
			InputStream
					->read data from any source
					->.source->file, array, peripheral device
					->Methods:
							->read
							->available
							->close
			OutputStream
					Methods:
						1. write(int) -> used to write a byte to current o/p stream
						2. write(byte[])->used to write an array of byte
						3. close() -> current file needs to be closed			
						4. flush() -> same file->reading/writing->flushed before closed
	->File Handling
			->File
			->FileOutputStream
			->FileInputStream
			->BufferedOutputStream
			->BufferedInputStream
			Copying content from one file to another:
				1. Source File Name :D:/a1.docx
				2. Destination File Name: D:/a2.docx
	->Serialization
				->Write state of an object into byte stream.
						->writeObject()
				->reverse of serialization->deserialization
						->readObject()
