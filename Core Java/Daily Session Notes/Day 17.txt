SPring Framework:
	1. Dependency Injection
			->SI-> partial dependency is possible
			->CI -> No Partial dependency is possible
			->Autowiring
					->byName
					->byType
					->byconstructor
	2. Spring AOP	
			->OOPS -> class
			->AOP
				->Aspect Oriented Programming
				->breaking the program logic into distinct parts
				->aspect
				->cross-cutting concerns-> centralized part of the application
			->Implementation of AOP:
					1. By XML
					2. By Annotation base configuration.			
			-> Terminologies
					1. Join Point
							->any point in the program :-> method execution variable access, exception handling

					2. Advice->Operation that is taken on a JoinPoinr.
								->bEFORE Advice
								->After Advice
								->AfterThrowing ADvice
								->AfterReturning
					3. Point cut
									->expression tag
									(....k*)
					4. Inreoduction

					5. Target Object
					6. Aspect -> combination of classes and advice,joinpoint
					7. AOP Proxy
					8. Weaving
